% Observation & Comments:
% It can be clearly observed that the max error in the estimation for the
% derivative wrt to x decreases as the sampling width decreases while for
% the derivative wrt y the max error actually increases as the sampling width
% decreases. This might possibly be because in the range of x greater than
% pi the linear approxmation for the sin function in the estimated formulae
% becomes worse and hence the error becomes bigger as the sampling window is
% magnified.
